# About the project

I made this in the process for learn more about TailwindCSS and FrontEnd development. This is a slider that presents a series of commercial juices.

## How to run

Install the main depenendcies:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npm install react-icons --save
npm install sass # only used in globals.scss for some complex animations
```
Visit https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs in order to learn how to configure TailwindCSS if needed.

There are other dependencies installed but are not used.

After you have installed the dependencies, you can do

```bash
npm run dev
```
And then the development server should run.
